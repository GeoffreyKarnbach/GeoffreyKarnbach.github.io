<p>I’m <strong>Geoffrey Karnbach</strong>, a <strong>20-year-old Software Engineer</strong>, half <strong>French</strong> and half <strong>Austrian</strong>, with a passion for programming that began when I was 11. My expertise lies in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I am proficient in frameworks like <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>SpringBoot</strong>, and <strong>Angular</strong>. At <strong>TU Wien</strong>, I contributed to research projects like <strong>OSSDIP</strong> and <strong>DBREPO</strong>, where I implemented Python microservices and developed frontend components with Vue.js.</p>

<p>Among my Full Stack projects, I've worked on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CryptoPay</strong> - A simple solution for <strong>cryptocurrency payments</strong> in physical locations, designed to work as seamlessly as a credit card transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Ländr</strong> - A platform developed to help users <strong>find and book party locations</strong> easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipe Planer</strong> - A practical tool that combines a <strong>digital cookbook</strong> with a <strong>smart grocery planner</strong> to streamline meal preparation.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the realm of <strong>data science and machine learning</strong>, I’ve worked on several projects including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fake News Detector</strong> - Identifies misinformation in articles.</li>
  <li><strong>Spotify Language Detection</strong> - Organizes playlists by song language using a custom model.</li>
  <li><strong>Titanic Survival Analysis</strong> - Examines survival probabilities based on historical data.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a solid foundation in tools like <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>UML</strong>, and <strong>Ansible</strong>, and I am fluent in <strong>German</strong>, <strong>French</strong>, and <strong>English</strong>. My interests span <strong>full-stack development</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>data science</strong>, and <strong>mobile app engineering</strong>. I am dedicated to continually learning and applying new technologies to solve real-world problems. Through my work, I aim to create innovative solutions that have a meaningful impact on everyday tasks and user experiences.</p>
